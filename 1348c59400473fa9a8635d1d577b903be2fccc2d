      "message": "Bit of a nit, but `sig_atomic_t` is defined as an integer type, and integer types with static storage duration are defined to be initialised to zero by default, so the assignment of `false` isn\u0027t strictly necessary. Also, given it\u0027s not explicitly a `bool` (any more than any integer in C can look like a bool) I\u0027d mildly prefer we avoid using `true`/`false` as well.",
