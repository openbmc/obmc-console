      "message": "This obscures warnings from e.g. valgrind and other sanitizers about access to uninitialised data. Sanitizer warnings are arguably a better outcome than access to initialised data that is (to some degree) invalid.\n\nThe uninitialised object is mooted by the fact that we immediately `memcpy()` into the buffer and explicitly terminate it, thereby initialising it. Any writes to the buffer prior are redundant. I don\u0027t see squashing the warning from the tool as beneficial, though I will be swayed if other obmc-console maintainers see some benefit.",
