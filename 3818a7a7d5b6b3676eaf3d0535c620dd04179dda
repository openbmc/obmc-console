      "message": "```sd_bus_get_fd``` does not succeed in the console-server when i do that.\n\nTo me it looks like it is not allowed to re-use the bus connection in a child process like described here\nhttps://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/sd_bus_get_fd.html#\n\nI think the AI described it pretty well:\n```\nTo handle D-Bus connections using sd_bus_default() in both parent and child \nprocesses, you should avoid sharing the sd_bus connection and associated file \ndescriptors across process boundaries. Instead, you should create a new sd_bus \nconnection in the child process.\n\n\nWhen you call sd_bus_default() in the parent process and then fork a child process, \nthe file descriptors associated with the D-Bus connection are inherited by the \nchild process, but the actual resources (context, etc.) are not safely shared. This \nis why sd_bus_get_fd() fails in the child process.\n\n```\n\nReworked things so now the tests are creating the dbus connection in ```fork_off_console_server``` and the connection is released in the individual tests.\n\nThe d-bus connection is created after the child has been forked off so no d-bus resources are leaked to the child.",
