      "message": "One other thing that just occurred to me...is 0644 the right mode to be passing here?  I suspect in most existing deployments OpenBMC effectively runs as a single-user system (with nearly all processes running as root), but I think there are some efforts underway working towards changing that, which makes me wonder if maybe it shouldn\u0027t be world-readable.  Maybe 0600 instead?",
