Prevent us from using \u003c clang-format-17, and\n3. clang-format-17 is only available via the Debian experimental archive for Sid, and\n4. The maintainers not currently on leave are both running Debian\n\nI think we might hold off on this for a little bit.",

Since this is a C repository it seems to have pretty minimal .clang-format changes.  This option seems to have been introduced back in clang-11, so I don\u0027t think there is any risk in merging now.",
