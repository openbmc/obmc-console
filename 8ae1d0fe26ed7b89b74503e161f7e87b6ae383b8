      "message": "Hello. I wanted to chime into the discussion coming from bmcweb. Due to the fact, that the current redfish implementation for hostlogs coming from phosphor-hostlogger is unclear and there being an interest to move to the hostlogs coming from obmc-console, we would benefit from this change adding timestamps to the log messages.",

      "message": "The box-drawing mode is totally fine, because the entire box-drawing sequence is sent in one message, so there will be only a single timestamp before the drawing. I can show you what the log looks like if you want.\n\nIf the input contains control characters like \u0027\\r\u0027, which moves the cursor back to the beginning of the line, using \"cat\" to view the file may result in the timestamp being overwritten. However, if you open the file with \"vi\" (which does not interpret control characters), the timestamp will be displayed correctly.",

This would be intended to use as an 8-bit-clean log of the data, and you would be able to timestamp/etc as necessary.\n\nThis would involve conversion from binary into ASCII (or even utf-8), before interpreting as text, and coming up with a strategy for that conversion. A simple initial approach may be to substitute invalid bytes.",
