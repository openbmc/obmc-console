      "message": "\u003e This however cannot do asan / ubsan on the code. \n\nCan you unpack your concerns here?\n\nFor reference, in the following gist I introduce a heap overflow, and it it is detected just fine by ASAN:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/amboar/afe2352080d9280df07f44105b4d7a9f\n\nThis works because the `obmc-console-server` binary is compiled and linked with ASAN support, as requested by `meson setup -Db_sanitize\u003daddress,undefined`, and we invoke the built binary. This goes for `obmc-console-client` as well.\n\n\u003e Also the code from the application cannot be re-used for the test.\n\nAs a maintainer of the code, for test cases like what I\u0027ve demonstrated here, copy/paste isn\u0027t high on my list of concerns. It\u0027s fine. It\u0027s just test code. We can always rework it later if becomes a maintenance concern, which, as a maintainer of obmc-console, is my problem to fix given I\u0027m asking you to create it. Please don\u0027t consider discarding the \"DRY\" principle a blocker to writing shell scripts for the tests.\n\n(A final nit is that the script is written for `sh` and not `bash`. It runs just fine in e.g. the [dash](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dash.1.html) shell, which is constrained to the POSIX shell specification. IMO `bash` has a lot of features that allow the implementation to creep into the territory of \"this should not be a shell script\", and should be avoided).",

      "message": "Well meson has always been hard to grasp for me. Probably it did not work for me in this way because i never specified ```depends: [ server ],```.\n\nThe shell version is really a lot shorter and if asan works then it\u0027s fine with me.\n\nStarted implementing the tests in shell, for some reason some of them still fail in CI, but not when i run them in CI locally. Maybe i need to isolate them even more.\n\nHere\u0027s the patch series: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/obmc-console/+/73272",
