I had backtracked on that previously, and Jeremy considers splitting the configuration files to be a bit unwieldy, and suggests adding sections:\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/obmc-console/+/71228/comments/c34a7dff_7e6e2144",

It does not make sense to me to document something that\u0027s different from the working code.\n\nSo I\u0027m almost solely reviewing this documentation patch at the moment in the absence of any [design document](https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/design-template.md) for the feature. What you\u0027re doing here is not really small or self-contained, and I think is well suited to setting a direction using the project\u0027s usual method.\n\nI would like to set my own expectations about what I will see in the code before I get bogged down in the minutia of C and the implementation.\n\nIf you want to constrain this patch to the implementation, then how do you feel about writing a separate design document? That might be a more coherent way to make progress that doesn\u0027t leave you changing the implementation on a whim every other day.",
