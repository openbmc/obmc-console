## To Build

To build this project, run the following shell commands:

```
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
```

To test:

```
meson test -C build
```

## To Run Server

Running the server requires a serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0):

```
touch obmc-console.conf
./obmc-console-server --config obmc-console.conf ttyS0
```

## To Connect Client

To connect to the server, simply run the client:

```
./obmc-console-client
```

To disconnect the client, use the standard `~.` combination.

## Underlying design

This shows how the host UART connection is abstracted within the BMC as a Unix
domain socket.

```

This supports multiple independent consoles. The socket-id is a unique portion
for the unix domain socket created by the obmc-console-server instance. The
server needs to know this because it needs to know what to name the pipe; the
client needs to know it as it needs to form the abstract socket name to which to
connect.
