## To Build

To build this project, run the following shell commands:

```
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
```

To test:

```
meson test -C build
```

## To Run Server

Running the server requires a serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0):

```
touch obmc-console.conf
./obmc-console-server --config obmc-console.conf ttyS0
```

## To Connect Client

To connect to the server, simply run the client:

```
./obmc-console-client
```

To disconnect the client, use the standard `~.` combination.

## Underlying design

This shows how the host UART connection is abstracted within the BMC as a Unix
domain socket.

```

This supports multiple independent consoles. The `console-id` is a unique
portion for the unix domain socket created by the obmc-console-server instance.
The server needs to know this because it needs to know what to name the pipe;
the client needs to know it as it needs to form the abstract socket name to
which to connect.

## Mux Support

In some hardware designs, multiple UARTS may be available behind a Mux. Please
reference
[docs/mux-support.md](https://github.com/openbmc/obmc-console/blob/master/docs/mux-support.md)
in that case.

## Sample Development Setup

For developing obmc-console, we can use pseudo terminals (pty's) in Linux.

The socat command will output names of 2 pty's, one of which is the master and
the other one is the slave. The master pty can be used to emulate a UART.

```
$ socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,link=pty1 pty,raw,echo=0,link=pty2

$ obmc-console-server --console-id dev $(realpath pty2)

$ obmc-console-client -i dev

# this message should appear for the client
$ echo "hi" > pty1

```
