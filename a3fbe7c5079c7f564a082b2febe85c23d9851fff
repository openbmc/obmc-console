      "message": "I\u0027m okay with this change, but keep in mind that the proposed setup (only starting the console service on connect) will break two things:\n\n* logging: console logs will only generated when there is a client attached, which sorta defeats the purpose of the log buffer\n* local (physical) serial ports: no mirroring to local serial ports (specified by `local-tty`) will occur where no SoL or Redfish console is attached.\n\nIs that OK for your use-case?",

      "message": "This needs to be templated as well in accordance with the code defining the socket name. The current pattern in the implementation is `@obmc-console.${socket-id}`. Maybe it\u0027s best if we fix the logic in [1] so that there\u0027s always a socket-id (e.g. set it to \"default\" by default) rather than conditionally appending the `.${socket-id}`.",
