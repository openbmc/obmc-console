      "message": "Hi Alexander, I\u0027ve reworked a few commits in the chain to address some of the comments i left, but also to address a collection of warnings from valgrind under various conditions. In the end I\u0027ve tested the series up to this commit on an AST2600 EVB, configuring obmc-console to use the heartbeat LED pin as the mux GPIO. It appears to behave as we\u0027ve specified without any further warnings from valgrind. I think any further changes can go in as fixes on top.\n\nThanks for your efforts so far!",
