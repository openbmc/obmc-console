      "message": "I\u0027m making this comment after reading the updated documentation (and without having yet looked at the implementation).\n\nSo: I don\u0027t yet understand this point. By \"dbus name\" are you referring to the well-known DBus connection name? We can claim multiple well-known names in the one process. This behaviour is explicitly called out in the DBus specification:\n\n\u003e Object paths are often namespaced by starting with a reversed domain name and containing an interface version number, in the same way as interface names and well-known bus names. This makes it possible to implement more than one service, or more than one version of a service, in the same process, even if the services share a connection but cannot otherwise co-operate (for instance, if they are implemented by different plugins). \n\nhttps://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-marshaling-object-path\n\nIt feels to me like we\u0027d remove a lot of complexity by using one server process per (muxed) TTY. For proposed control semantics, perhaps we could do \"most recent client wins\" as a means to switch the mux, with all existing clients then disconnected, the mux switched, and then the new client accepted (whether that meets other non-functional requirements needs discussion).",

      "message": "Sorry, quoted the wrong part of the DBus spec there (grabbed the bit about object paths instead of connection names). This seems like a better fit for my intent:\n\n\u003e Connections have one or more bus names associated with them.\n\u003e\n\u003e ...\n\u003e\n\u003e  As with interface names, including a version number in well-known bus names is a good idea; it\u0027s possible to have the well-known bus name for more than one version simultaneously if backwards compatibility is required.\n\nhttps://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus\n\nBut together I think they illustrate that it\u0027s feasible to achieve this in the one process.",
