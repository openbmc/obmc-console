Apologies in advance.\n\nHowever, can we please separate out the addition of the new interface from the removal of the old interface, in that order? We should add entries to `CHANGELOG.md` also.\n\nOnce the new interface is added I\u0027ll create a release (really just munging `CHANGELOG.md` and creating a tag). Once the release is created we can merge the patch removing the old interface. This at least provides any users of the old interface with a path for transition at the intermediate point where both interfaces are exposed.",
