All contributors that have a CLA are added to a Gerrit group that CI consults to figure out whether it should run. CI hasn\u0027t run here, so you must not currently be part of a CLA group.\n\nThere\u0027s more info here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#starting-out\n\nIf you have an employer that has already signed an OpenBMC CLA then we can add you to the appropriate group.",
