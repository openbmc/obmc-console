      "message": "We should unwind the updates to `console-\u003en_pollers` and `console-\u003epollers` here too, otherwise we have a dangling pointer in `console-\u003epollers[n]` (apologies I hadn\u0027t picked up on this earlier).\n\nPerhaps it\u0027s best to try to allocate the pollfd first. As it stands now we assume `reallocarray()` never fails, so there\u0027s no need to unwind the pollfd request if we re-order the sequence (but please add a comment about that so when we clean up the `reallocarray()` issue we make sure to clean up the pollfd allocation as well).",
